             <p>Hello, and welcome to my website!

Since your time is valuable, let me guide you through my site swiftly.

If you have no idea what I do, my CV is right here. To explore my work, check out my favourite case, as well as my pet project.

If I am the appointed patent attorney on your case and you're researching my portfolio, you might be trying to gauge my expertise. Open dialogue is integral to my work approach, and I encourage constructive criticism. If you identify any errors or areas for improvement, please feel free to bring it to my attention.

Additionally, I am sharing my reading list here, which might provide some insights into my thought process.

If you're unable to find what you're looking for, feel free to send me a message.

Best,
Nikolai</p>
