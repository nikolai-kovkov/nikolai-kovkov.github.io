             <p>Hi, thanks for checking my website.  

Since your time is valuable, let me guide you through my site swiftly.

If you're curious about my professional journey, my CV is right here. To explore my work, check out my favourite case, as well as this pet project. Speaking of publications and presentations, you can find a list of the most relevant ones here.
‍
If you are an IP professional seeking to navigate opportunities in Russia and neighbouring countries, I have consolidated some news and insights here in my X, gathered from my own experiences.

Lastly, for those who seek a more personal exchange or to delve into the quotidian musings that occupy my thoughts, my personal telegram channel is open to you.

If you haven't found what you're looking for, please feel free to send me a message.

Best,
Nikolai</p>
